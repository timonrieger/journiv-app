# Docker Compose Override for OLD version in Upgrade Tests
#
# This override is used when starting OLD versions during upgrade testing.
# Older versions may not have celery-worker service, so we scale it to 0.
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.sqlite.yml \
#     -f docker-compose.override.ci.yml \
#     -f docker-compose.override.old-version.yml \
#     up -d

services:
  # Don't start celery-worker for OLD versions (may not exist in old releases)
  celery-worker:
    deploy:
      replicas: 0
